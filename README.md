 

**Agentless** is an *agentless* approach to automatically solve software development problems. To solve each issue, **Agentless** follows a simple three phase process: localization, repair, and patch validation.
- 🙀 **Localization**: Agentless employs a hierarchical process to first localize the fault to specific files, then to relevant classes or functions, and finally to fine-grained edit locations
- 😼 **Repair**: Agentless takes the edit locations and samples multiple candidate patches per bug in a simple diff format
- 😸 **Patch Validation**: Agentless selects the regression tests to run and generates additional reproduction test to reproduce the original error. Using the test results, Agentless re-ranks all remaining patches to selects one to submit

This is a modified version of [Agentless(https://github.com/OpenAutoCoder/Agentless) that can perform localization on Java projects (particularly the GHRB dataset).
N.B: Repair and Patch Validation might not work.
